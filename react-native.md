### Introduction

With React, you can make components using either classes or functions. Originally, class components were the only components that could have state. But since the introduction of React's Hooks API, you can add state and more to function components.

Functional components:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';

const HelloWorldApp = () => {
  return (
    <View style={{
        flex: 1,
        justifyContent: 'center',
        alignItems: 'center'
      }}>
      <Text>Hello, world!</Text>
    </View>
  );
}

export default HelloWorldApp;
```

Class components:

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';

class HelloWorldApp extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <View style={{
          flex: 1,
          justifyContent: "center",
          alignItems: "center"
        }}>
        <Text>Hello, world!</Text>
      </View>
    );
  }
}

export default HelloWorldApp;
```

## Core Components and Native Components

In Android and iOS development, a **view** is the basic building block of UI: a small rectangular element on the screen which can be used to display text, images, or respond to user input. Even the smallest visual elements of an app, like a line of text or a button, are kinds of views. Some kinds of views can contain other views. Itâ€™s views all the way down!

In Android development, you write views in Kotlin or Java; in iOS development, you use Swift or Objective-C. With React Native, you can invoke these views with JavaScript using React components. At runtime, React Native creates the corresponding Android and iOS views for those components. Because React Native components are backed by the same views as Android and iOS, React Native apps look, feel, and perform like any other apps. We call these platform-backed components **Native Components**.

React Native has many Core Components for everything from form controls to activity indicators.

REACT NATIVE UI COMPONENT | ANDROID VIEW | IOS VIEW | WEB ANALOG | DESCRIPTION
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<View>` | `<ViewGroup>` | `<UIView>` | A non-scrollling `<div>` | A container that supports layout with flexbox, style, some touch handling, and accessibility controls |
| `<Text>` | `<TextView>` | `<UITextView>` | `<p>` | Displays, styles, and nests strings of text and even handles touch events |
| `<Image>` | `<ImageView>` | `<UIImageView>` | `<img>` | Displays different types of images |
| `<ScrollView>` | `<ScrollView>` | `<UIScrollView>` | `<div>` | A generic scrolling container that can contain multiple components and views |
| `<TextInput>` | `<EditText>` | `<UITextField>` | `<input type="text">` | Allows the user to enter text |
